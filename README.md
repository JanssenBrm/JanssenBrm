# Hi 👋, Bram Janssen here! 👨‍💻
<h4 align="center">Full stack FTW!</h4>

I am a full stack software engineer with a very big passion for technology in general. I love to experiment with different languages and frameworks, usually with a main focus on web related frameworks, such as Angular, React, NodeJS, Express, NestJS,... This usually results in some interesting side projects. Feel free to look around and give me a shout on Twitter [@_bramjanssen](https://twitter.com/_bramjanssen). 

## Blog post
Lately I have also started sharing the results of my experiments on Medium. I am still starting this up, but I really like to share the things I've learned in my different side projects. My post are shared on my Medium account, [brm-janssen](https://brm-janssen.medium.com/). 

My latest posts:
